# VaccinationDistribution


## To-Do:
- find realistic parameter
- Use step-wise function
- Use step-wise optimization with new incoming data points
- Functional form of inter-spatial infections (robustness checks for different functions!)


## Further tasks 

- Markov-jump processes 
- Add noise (optimal control problem for discrete model)
- Implement inter-spatial infections by individuals that are in another country (new model)
- Incorporate reinfections
- Incorporate tests (Can we substitute vaccination by testing? Optimal distribution of vaccines and tests)

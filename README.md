# VaccinationDistribution


## To-Do:
- neural-nets (~ 20. July)
- try deterministic rule for noise models ('til submission)
- sensitivity: hyperbolic tangent vs logistic
- give more application specific intuition within the methodology section
- compute null space (flux vectors)


## Further tasks 
- Implement inter-spatial infections by individuals that are in another country (new model)
- Incorporate reinfections
- Incorporate tests (Can we substitute vaccination by testing? Optimal distribution of vaccines and tests)

# VaccinationDistribution


## To-Do:
- neural-nets (~ 20. July)
- try deterministic rule for noise models
- sensitivity: hyperbolic tangent vs logistic
- give more application specific intuition within the methodology section

##Schedule
- explain deterministic algorithm
- write not so empirical model that shows higher impact (one vaccine per virus); more theoretical exercise


## Further tasks 
- Implement inter-spatial infections by individuals that are in another country (new model)
- Incorporate reinfections
- Incorporate tests (Can we substitute vaccination by testing? Optimal distribution of vaccines and tests)

# VaccinationDistribution


## To-Do:
- Write model graph in sbgn
- rewrite description
- create continuous integration
- Create time varying rules that determine vaccination rates (Find appropriate Vaccination strategies)
- Functional form of inter-spatial infections 
- Add noise
- Write function to optimize over



## Further tasks 

- Markov-jump processes 
- Implement inter-spatial infections by individuals that are in another country (new model)
- Incorporate reinfections
- Incorporate tests (Can we substitute vaccination by testing? Optimal distribution of vaccines and tests)

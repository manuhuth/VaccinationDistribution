\section{Rule-based modeling}

In the proposed model the compartments are Susceptible ($S$), Infectious ($I$), Recovered and Dead ($D$). Individuals either live in area one ($a_1$) or area two ($a_2$). They are non-vaccinated ($v_0$), vaccinated with vaccine one $(v_1)$ or vaccinated with vaccine two ($v_2$). Since we are dealing with two virus variants, the wild type $w$ and the mutant $m$, we account for this by introducing the feature $c_j$ with $j \in \{w,m\}$ that indicates the type of virus we are refering to. 
 
We use the set notation of \cite{Waites.2021} to address certain subsets of the population. $\set()$ means all individuals. $\set(x_u)$ denotes all individuals from compartment $u \in \{S, I, R, D \}$, $\set(a_l)$ denotes all individuals from area $l \in \{1,2\}$, $\set(v_i)$ are all individuals with vaccination status $i \in \{0,1,2\}$, where zero indicates non-vaccinated, and $\set(c_j)$ are all individuals that currently have or had an infection with virus $j \in \{w,m\}$. With this notation we can pick desired subsets of the population by combining the appropriate features. All individuals from area one that are infected with the wild type are addressed by $\set(x_I, c_m)$. If we only want the unvaccinated individuals of them we use $\set(x_I, c_m, v_0)$. The usual set operators, like $\cup$. Using these operators allows us to address even more specific subsets like the set of all vaccinated individuals $\set(v_1) \cup \set(v_2)$. The set $\set()$ is defined as the whole population. The cardinalty $|\cdot|$ is used to addres the respective number of individuals in a set, e.g. $|\set(x_S, a_1)|$ equals the number of all susceptible individuals in area one.\\

In more specific cases it might be more comprehensive to replace the index numbers by meaningful abbreviations.

\subsection{Model}

The following list gives a brief description of the parameters used to describe the model. 
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Parameter}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\nu_j \in (0,1)$ for $j=1,2$: vaccination rate of vaccine $j$
    \item $\alpha_i \in (0,1)$ for $i=b,m$: infection rate of virus $i$
    \item $\delta_i \in (0,1)$  for $i=b,m$: death rate of unvaccinated individuals that are infected with virus i
    \item $\beta_i \in (0,1)$ for $i=b,m$: recover rate of unvaccinated individuals that are infected with virus i
    \item $\omega_{i,j} \in (0,1)$ for $i=b,m$ and $j=1,2$: how much percent of the people that are vaccinated with vaccine $i$ die less due to virus $j$. 
    \item $f_{i,j} \in (0,\infty)$ for $i,j=1,2$: average number of people meeting between area $a_i$ and area $a_j$. It should hold that $f_{i,j} = f_{j,i}$ and $f_{i,i} > f_{i,j}$ for all $i \neq j$.
    \item $\gamma \in (0,1)$: inverse proportion of immunity that remains after vaccination ($\gamma =0$ means vaccine makes $100\%$ immune)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}


\textbf{Assumptions so far:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item no distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic infected cases
    \item no vaccination during infection \href{https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html}{see here} (US Center for Disease Control)
    \item no births and other deaths
    \item no reinfection
    \item vaccination decreases infection rate by $\gamma \in (0,1)$ and is the same for both vaccines across both viruses
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transition Rates}

\subsubsection*{Vaccination}
For $j \in \{1,2\}$
\begin{align*}
\set(x_S, v_0, a_1) &\xrightarrow{\nu_j(t-k)} \set(x_S, v_j, a_1) \notag \\
\set(x_R, v_0, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{\nu_j(t-k)} \set(x_R, v_j, c_w, a_1)
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Susceptible to Infectious}
We define $N_l(t) = |\set(x_S, a_l) \cup \set(x_I, a_l) \cup \set(x_R, a_l)|$ as the number of living individuals in area $l$.

From $\set(x_S, v_0, a_1)$ to $\set(x_I, v_0, c_w, a_1)$ (\textit{do not forget to multiply by} $|\set(x_S, v_0, a_1)|$)
\begin{align*}
rate(v_0) = \alpha b \left[ \frac{p_m}{N_1(t) + N_2(t)} \left(|\set(x_I, v_0, c_w, a_1)| + \gamma |\set(x_I, v_1, c_w, a_1) \cup \set(x_I, v_2, c_w, a_1)|\right) \right. \notag \\
\left. + \frac{(1-p_m)N_1(t) + N_2(t)}{N_1(t) + N_2(t))N_2(t)}  \left(|\set(x_I, v_0, c_w, a_2)| + \gamma |\set(x_I, v_1, c_w, a_2) \cup \set(x_I, v_2, c_w, a_2)|\right) \right]
\end{align*}
The rule is defined by 
\begin{align*}
\set(x_S, v_0, a_1) \xrightarrow{rate(v_0)} \set(x_I, v_0, c_w, a_1)
\end{align*}

From $\set(x_S, v_i, a_1)$ to $\set(x_I, v_i, c_w, a_1)$ for $i \in \{1,2\}$. (\textit{do not forget to multiply by} $|\set(x_S, v_i, a_1)|$)
\begin{align*}
\set(x_S, v_0, a_1) \xrightarrow{\rho_{i,w} \cdot rate(v_0, c_1) } \set(x_I, v_0, c_w, a_1)
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Infectious to Recovered/Death}
non-vaccinated
\begin{align}
    P(x_I,  v_0, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{p \lambda} P(x_D,  v_0, c_w, a_1) \notag \\
P(x_I,  v_0, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{q(1-p) \lambda} P(x_R,  v_0, c_w, a_1, S_y) \notag \\
P(x_I,  v_0, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{(1-q)(1-p) \lambda} P(x_R,  v_0, c_w, a_1, S_n) \notag
\end{align}

vaccinated. for $i \in \{1,2\}$
\begin{align}
    P(x_I,  v_i, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{\omega_{i,w} p \lambda} P(x_D,  v_i, c_w, a_1) \notag \\
P(x_I,  v_i, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{q(1-\omega_{i,w}p) \lambda} P(x_R,  v_i, c_w, a_1, S_y) \notag \\
P(x_I,  v_i, c_w, a_1) &\xrightarrow{(1-q)(1-\omega_{i,w}p) \lambda} P(x_R,  v_i, c_w, a_1, S_n) \notag
\end{align}


To-do: write mutant and write that everything applies for area 2 as well



\subsection{Rules}
The rules are written down using the $P$-notation. For the transition from non-vaccinated individuals to recovered or dead individuals, we need two rules that are dependent on the virus type. For $i = b,m$
\begin{align}
    P(x_{I_i},  v_0) &\xrightarrow{\delta_i} P(x_{D_i}, v_0) \\
    P(x_{I_i},  v_0) &\xrightarrow{\beta_i} P(x_{R_i},  v_0).\notag
\end{align}

The vaccination can be described by two rules. \textit{For the purpose of the analysis we should think of making} $\nu_1$ \textit{and} $\nu_2$ \textit{time-dependent.}
\begin{align}
    P(S, v_0) &\xrightarrow{\nu_1} P(S, v_1) \\
    P(S, v_0) &\xrightarrow{\nu_2} P(S, v_2).\notag
\end{align}

For the transition from vaccinated individuals to recovered or dead individuals, we need two rules that are dependent on the virus type and the type of vaccination. For $i = b,m$ For $i = b,m$ and $s = 1,2$. \textit{Using} $(2-\omega_{i,1})$ \textit{has the advantage that we need to define less parameters. However, I would program it as single parameter and then change it accordingly during the parameter specification.}
\begin{align}
    P(x_{I_i},  v_s) &\xrightarrow{\omega_{i,s} \delta_i} P(x_{D_i}, v_s) \\
    P(x_{I_i}, v_s) &\xrightarrow{(2-\omega_{i,s})\beta_i} P(x_{R_i}, v_s)\notag
\end{align}

For the transitions from susceptible to infectious we need to distinguish in between meetings of individuals from the same area and in between vaccination types. We write down the rules for Susceptible individuals from area one. The same logic with slightly different indices applies for area two. 
For $l = 1,2$ and $i = b,m$ the infection of unvaccinated individuals can be described by
\begin{align}
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_0), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_0) &\xrightarrow{\alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_0), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_0) \\
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_1), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_0) &\xrightarrow{\gamma \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_1), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_0)\notag\\
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_2), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_0) &\xrightarrow{\gamma \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_2), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_0).\notag
\end{align}
We need similar rules for the infection of individuals vaccinated with vaccine one. Their average number of infection is lowered by $\sigma_{i,1}$, yielding for $l = 1,2$ and $i = b,m$ the rules 
\begin{align}
  P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_0), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_1) &\xrightarrow{\sigma_{i,1} \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_0), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_1) \\
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_1), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_1) &\xrightarrow{\gamma \sigma_{i,1} \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_1), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_1) \notag\\
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_2), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_1) &\xrightarrow{\gamma \sigma_{i,1} \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_2), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_1) \notag
\end{align}
Analogously, we can define the infection of individuals vaccinated with vaccine two using $\sigma_{i,2}$. The rules are for $l = 1,2$ and $i = b,m$. 
\begin{align}
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_0), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_2) &\xrightarrow{\sigma_{i,2} \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_0), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_2) \\
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_1), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_2) &\xrightarrow{\gamma \sigma_{i,2} \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_1), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_2)\notag\\
    P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_2), P(x_{S}, a_1, v_2) &\xrightarrow{\gamma \sigma_{i,2} \alpha_i f_{l,1}} P(x_{I_i}, a_l, v_2), P(x_{I_i}, a_1, v_2)\notag
\end{align}

# VaccinationDistribution


## To-Do:
- find appropriate quantity of vaccine inflow
- rewrite piecewise SBML
- neural-nets (~ 20. July)
- try deterministic rule for noise models ('til submission)


## Further tasks 

- Markov-jump processes 
- Add noise (optimal control problem for discrete model)
- Implement inter-spatial infections by individuals that are in another country (new model)
- Incorporate reinfections
- Incorporate tests (Can we substitute vaccination by testing? Optimal distribution of vaccines and tests)
